**  Supply Chain Performance Optimization **

Domian: FMCG 


**Situation:**  
AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer operational in Gujarat, faced challenges with customer retention due to service issues. Key customers had not renewed their annual contracts, citing delayed or incomplete deliveries. Management wanted a solution to track and improve delivery service levels to ensure customer satisfaction and support expansion plans to Tier-1 cities.

**Task:**  
As a Supply Chain Data Analyst, I was tasked with developing a comprehensive dashboard to measure key supply chain metrics, including **On-Time Delivery (OT%), In-Full Delivery (IF%), and On-Time In-Full Delivery (OTIF%)**. The objective was to track daily service levels, identify gaps, and ensure performance aligned with customer expectations.

**Action:**  
- Consolidated data from six sources, including customer, product, date, order, and target-level tables.  
- Designed metrics to calculate **Line Fill Rate, Volume Fill Rate, OT%, IF%, and OTIF%** using SQL for data preprocessing.  
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters for **customer, product, city, and date** to provide actionable insights.  
- Analyzed trends and highlighted customers/products falling below target service levels for focused interventions.  
- Conducted root-cause analysis to identify delays or incomplete deliveries and shared findings with stakeholders.  

**Result:**  
- Improved visibility into delivery performance with a dashboard enabling daily tracking of OT, IF, and OTIF metrics.  
- Identified and resolved service gaps, leading to a 15% improvement in OTIF performance within the first quarter.  
- Enhanced customer retention by addressing delivery issues proactively, laying a solid foundation for expansion plans.
